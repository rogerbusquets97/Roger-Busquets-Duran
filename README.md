# UI
## Roger Busquets Duran
### Personal involment

As part of the Ice Crew team, I was in charge of the User Interface. I implemented all the UI features in the game, ensuring with the designer and the artist that all the implementations were correct. Beyond my role, I also tried to help my teammates and solve bugs that were not from the UI. 

### UI features

- ### Main Screen
Implementation of the main menu. The player can choose to continue going to dungeons or set to new game. Inside settings he/she is able to mute the game and change the controls. Inside dungeons, each dungeon is set with a level of difficulty and a yellow key is displayed beside each completed dungeon. The boss dungeon will be unlocked when the player gathers three keys, so all the three keys from the boss dungeon will be in yellow. When selecting a dungeon an image appears that shows the kind of enemies that the player will have to face inside the selected dungeon. If a dungeon has been completed, the player won't be able to play it again.

- ### HUD
During gameplay the player is able to see the current lifes, keys and rupees he/she has. 

- ### Inventory (Game Pause)
The player can open the inventory window where he will see all the objects he has and each object description. He will see also Link's stats. When the inventory is the game is paused. (Pausing game was also implemented by me).

- ### Menu (Game Pause)
If the player wants to come back to the main menu, quit the game or see the controls while he/she is ingame, he will be able to do it open the menu, that also pauses the game.

- ### NPCs & Dialogues
I develop a dialogue system and NPCs, though it is only used once in the final release. Each NPC has a dialogue assigned and is displayed whenever Link talks with them.

- ### Item description
Whenever Link is colliding with an item, a description of this item is displayed to let the player know what the object does, if he wants to buy it (only in the case that the object has a price) he will has to press the button assigned to buy.

- ### Remapping controls
Besides the remapping scene in the main screen I also enable the code to support remmaping of controls, for each action the player can do.

- ### Gamepad
I prepare the module input to support gamepads. And both Pau Olive and Pau Bonet wrote the code to read player's input. 

- ### FX
I placed most of the audio FX in the game along with Pau Olive.
